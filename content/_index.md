# Hi, I'm Ferdinand

I'm a developer based in Cologne, Germany, passionate about **Industrial IoT**, **open-source software**, and **Rust development**.

## What I Do

I work at [**UMH Systems GmbH**](https://umh.app), where I focus on developing solutions for industrial automation and IoT. We're building the open-source [**United Manufacturing Hub**](https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/united-manufacturing-hub) - a toolkit that enables companies to create their own reliable and secure Industrial IoT platforms.

My work spans:
- 🏭 **Industrial IoT** - Bridging the gap between traditional manufacturing and modern technology
- 🔧 **Systems Engineering** - Building robust, scalable infrastructure  
- 💻 **Open Source** - Contributing to projects that benefit the manufacturing community

As a side project, I'm developing [**Penguin Protect**](https://penguin-protect.app/) - an RNN-based anti-cheat system for games that runs completely server-side (preserving user privacy) and works across any platform.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- 🚴‍♂️ Cycling
- 🥾 Hiking
- 🏠 Tinkering with my homelab and maintaining servers at [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) (game servers, mail, file storage, ...)
- 📡 Running [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) networks and [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast) tracking
- 🎮 Gaming
- 🎲 Playing Pathfinder (pen & paper RPG)
